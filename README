Modify your scripts while they are being executed.

Usage: bylines SCRIPT_FILE [PARAMETERS ...]


SCRIPT_FILE will be executed using its interpreter according to the hashbang line.
The interpreter will get the file BY LINES through a pipe;
you can modify part of the file which has not been read yet;
at the end of the file the interpreter will not receive EOF,
instead it will wait for new lines to be appended to the file;
you have to terminate the interpreter explicitly using its appropriate command (exit, quit, ...).

If the interpreter reads only those lines it currently needs (like bash does),
then usually one line after the being executed line stays in the pipe
while the others can be modified.

The interpreter is spawned using this script (as its only child), 
so if you need to signal it, send the signal directly to the interpreter.
If this script is terminated using a signal, interpreter receives EOF.

Warning:
This script uses active/exponential waiting,
so you can notice slower execution or higher cpu consumption
in comparison to direct execution of the script.
